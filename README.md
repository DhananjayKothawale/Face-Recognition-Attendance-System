## 📌 Overview

The **Face Recognition Attendance System** automates the attendance process using facial recognition technology. It captures faces in real time from a webcam, recognizes them, and records attendance securely and efficiently.

This project is built using Python with libraries like `face_recognition`, `OpenCV`, and `Flask` for the backend.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 Real-time face recognition from webcam
- 🧠 Face encoding and training support
- 🗂️ Daily attendance saved in organized CSV files
- 🌐 Flask-based web interface
- 📊 Easy attendance retrieval and history tracking

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **OpenCV**
- **face_recognition**
- **Flask (Web Framework)**
- **HTML/CSS (Frontend)**
- **CSV / SQLite (Storage)**

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition-attendance.git
   cd face-recognition-attendance

2. **Install the required packages:**
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the Flask server:**
   python app.py

🧠 **How It Works**
- Upload training images for each user.
- System encodes and stores their facial features.
- At runtime, webcam scans faces in real time.
- If a face matches a trained user, attendance is marked with a timestamp.
- Data is saved to a CSV for record-keeping.
